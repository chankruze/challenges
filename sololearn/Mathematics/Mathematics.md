# Mathematics

Find which math expression matches the answer that you are given, if you have an integer answer, and a list of math expressions.

## Task
Test each math expression to find the first one that matches the answer that you are given.

## Input Format
Two inputs: an integer and a space separated string of math expressions. The following operations need to be supported: addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, division /.  
An expression can include multiple operations.

## Output Format
A string that tells the index of the first math expression that matches. If there are no matches, output 'none'.

## Sample Input
```
15
(2+100) (5*3) (14+1)
```

## Sample Output
```
index 1 
```

## Explanation
Index counting starts at 0, so **(5*3)** is at **index 1** and matches your answer of **15**.
